# Chicktws Challenge

Problem statement: An experiment was conducted to measure and compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens.

Newly hatched chicks were randomly allocated into six groups, and each group received a different feed supplement. Their weights in grams after six weeks are provided along with the feed types.

1. Calculate the average chick weight for each feed type.
2. Identify the feed that resulted in the highest average weight.
3. Create a table showing the maximum, minimum, and average weight for each feed type.
Dataset code: Chicktws

# Attitude Challenge

Problem statement: From a survey of administrative employees of a large financial organization, data is aggregated from the questionnaires of approximately 35 employees for each of 30 departments (randomly selected). The numbers give the percentage proportion of favorable responses to seven questions in each department.
Dictionary:
 rating: overall department rating 
 complaints: categorical factor about complaints
 privileges: access to benefits 
 learning: categorical factor about learning 
 raises: categorical factor about salary increases 
 critical: categorical factor about critical feedback 
 advance: growth opportunities
1. Calculate the average "learning" by motivation level (rating).
2. Find the combination of rating and complaints that has the highest average learning value.
3. What is the average learning level for employees who received above-average raises?
Dataset code: Attitude

# Titanic Challenge

1. What is the overall survival rate on the ship?
2. What is the survival rate by class (Pclass)?
3. Which sex has the highest survival rate?
4. Based on the data provided. How many adults and children (survivors) and non-survivors are there?
